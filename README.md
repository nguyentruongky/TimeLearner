# TimeLearner
A simple game to teach children learn how to read analog clock.

### What I did
- Get the question on server. The server is down. Sample data is loaded from local. 
- Render the analog clock. This library from [ClockAnimation](https://github.com/DuncanMC/ClockAnimation). This library is written with Objective-C, I parsed it to Swift. Thank you, Duncan. 
- Share the result on Facebook. 

### What should improve 
- Generate questions automatically. 
- Support iPad UI.
- The hour and minute hand should be rendered by code, not use UIImageView.
- The time period should change position to avoid the hand overlap.
